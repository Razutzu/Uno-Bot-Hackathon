# Introduction 🤖

# Buttons overview 🔘
- **💥 Uno!** - Calls "Uno!".
- **✅ Play!** - Plays a card when you drew a playable card.
- **❌ Keep!** - Keeps a card when you drew a playable card.
# How to play 🎮
- First of all, you need to create a game that users can enter. To do this, use the command `/create`. There can be only 1 game on a channel.
- If it is already an active game on a channel, you can use the command `/join` to join it.
- If you created a game and there are at least 2 players in it, use the command `/start` to start the game.
- When it's you turn, you can either draw a card, using the command `/draw`, or play a card, using the command `/play`.
- If you want to leave a game, you can use the command `/leave`. It doesn't matter if you're the creator of the game.
# Rules changed ⚙
- "A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence to prove that their hand meets this condition." & "If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card, the following player can challenge its use. The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately show their hand to the challenging player, in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards. If the challenge is correct, then the challenged player draws four cards instead. If the challenge is incorrect, then the challenger must draw six cards; the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards.". These rules have not been used.
- "Draw the top card from the deck, and play it if possible". If you draw a card and it is a Wild card or a Wild Draw Four card, you can only use it with the color that the bot chooses. However, you can keep it, but you will lose the turn.
